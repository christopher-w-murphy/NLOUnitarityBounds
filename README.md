NLOUnitarityBounds v0.1
Feb 2017

This package implements the algorithm for finding the (approximate) NLO unitarity bounds for the quartic couplings in a general renormalizable theory. 
It was made using Mathematica x11.0.1.0.
Examples and some documentation of the algorithm are shown in the supplementary file NLOUnitarityBounds-example.nb.
This is the 1st attempt to implement this algorithm in a Mathematica package; no doubt it could be done better. 
Please send comments and suggestions to the email address below.
