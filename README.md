NLOUnitarityBounds v0.2
July 2017

This package implements the algorithm for finding the (approximate) NLO unitarity bounds for the quartic couplings in a general renormalizable theory. It
was made using Mathematica x11.0.1.0. Please cite arXiv:1702.08511 if you use this package.

Examples and some documentation of the algorithm are shown 
in the supplementary file NLOUnitarityBounds-example.nb.

Please send comments and suggestions to the email address below. In addition, please contact the author if you would like an example notebook containing the 2HDM with its most general scalar potential.
