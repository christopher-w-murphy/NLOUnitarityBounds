NLOUnitarityBounds v0.2
July 2017

This package implements the algorithm for finding the (approximate) NLO unitarity bounds for the quartic couplings in a general renormalizable theory. The .m and .nb files were made using Mathematica x11.0.1.0. The .ipynb file was made using Jupyter Notebook 5.0.0 and Python 3.6.1. Please cite arXiv:1702.08511 if you use this package.

History

v0.1
This is the first attempt at making a Mathematica package to implement the algorithm for finding the (approximate) NLO unitarity bounds for the quartic couplings in a general renormalizable theory

v0.2
-A couple of minor improvements have been made to the .m file.
-The general 2HDM example was removed from the .nb file. Please contact me if you would like a notebook containing this model.
-The algorithm is now also available in Jupyter Notebook format.
